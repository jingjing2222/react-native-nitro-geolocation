# Why Nitro Module?

The **Nitro Module** system provides the next generation of native modules for React Native.
Instead of using the bridge-based approach (JSON serialization between JS and native), Nitro Modules communicate directly through **JSI (JavaScript Interface)**.

This enables:

- âš¡ **Direct native calls** â€” reduced overhead
- ðŸ§  **Synchronous APIs** for critical paths
- ðŸ”§ **Better integration** with the new Fabric renderer
- ðŸ§© **Cross-platform consistency** and simpler maintenance

In short, Nitro Geolocation builds on the proven API design of `@react-native-community/geolocation` while leveraging the new React Native architecture, providing a **forward-compatible foundation** with **100% API compatibility**.

## Architecture Comparison

### Origin: Event-based Architecture (`@react-native-community/geolocation`)

```
JavaScript Layer
  â†“ EventEmitter.addListener('geolocationDidChange', callback)
  â†“ (Callback stored in JS only)
React Native Bridge (JSON serialization)
  â†“
Native Layer (Android/iOS)
  â†“ LocationListener receives updates
  â†“ emit('geolocationDidChange', data) â†’ Bridge
  â†“
EventEmitter dispatches to all listeners
  â†“
User callback executed
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Callbacks **not passed** to native â€” stored in JS EventEmitter
- Native emits generic events through Bridge
- Multiple listeners share one event stream
- Requires JSON serialization on every update

### Modern: Direct Callback Architecture (`React Native Nitro Geolocation`)

```
JavaScript Layer
  â†“ nitroGeolocation.watchPosition(success, error, options)
  â†“ (Callbacks passed directly to native via JSI)
JSI Layer (No Bridge!)
  â†“
Native Layer (Kotlin/Swift)
  â†“ LocationListener receives updates
  â†“ callback.success(position) â†’ JSI direct call
  â†“
User callback executed immediately
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Callbacks **passed directly** to native as JSI function references
- Native calls JS functions directly (no Bridge)
- Each watch has its own callback (no shared event stream)
- Minimal serialization (C++ structs â†’ JS objects)

## How JSI Enables Direct Callbacks

Nitro Modules use **Nitrogen** code generation to create JSI bindings:

1. **TypeScript spec** (`NitroGeolocation.nitro.ts`) defines the interface
2. **Nitrogen generates C++ code** that bridges Kotlin/Swift â†” JSI
3. **HybridObject** in native code implements the spec
4. **JSI** holds references to JS functions and calls them directly

**Result:** When `watchPosition(callback)` is called, the `callback` function becomes a JSI function reference in native code, callable without the Bridge.

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Event-based if:
- Supporting React Native < 0.68
- Team unfamiliar with JSI/New Architecture
- Stability over performance

### Use Nitro (Direct Callback) if:
- Performance-critical (real-time tracking, animations)
- Using React Native New Architecture
- Need type safety at compile-time
- Building for the future

## Summary

`React Native Nitro Geolocation` transforms the geolocation API from a **Bridge-mediated event system** to a **JSI-powered direct callback system**, delivering native-level performance while maintaining 100% API compatibility with the original library.
